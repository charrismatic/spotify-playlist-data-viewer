Spotify API Workshop 1
=========================

A basic Node app that integrates with the Spotify API.

This app uses the *Client Credentials Flow* for authentication, which means you can only get non-user-specific data.

## Getting Started

1. After registering your app at developer.spotify.com, put your app's client ID and secret into the `.env`.
